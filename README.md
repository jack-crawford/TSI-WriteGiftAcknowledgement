## Write Gift Acknowledgement
Thanking donors is the cornerstone of good donor stewardship. With this Open AI solution in the Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit, donors can generate, customize, and send targeted gift acknowledgements to donors to thank them for their contributions to your mission.

With the click of a button, fundraisers can generate a draft acknowledgement email or letter that can be edited and sent to donors. The draft acknowledgement is generated by Open AI based on the context of a transaction, a donorâ€™s profile, taxable amounts, and designated funds in the Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit.
